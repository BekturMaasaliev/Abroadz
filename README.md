<br>

## React:
### After installing all the dependencies you can start the react:
**`npm start`**

<br>

## Json-server:
### in this project, there is its own fake database with a server called: json-server. In it you can create the same API queries as in the real database. All data are stored in json format. Enter the command to start the server:
**`npx json-server --watch db.sjon --port 8000`**
### json-server - keyword 
### db.json - name of file as a database
### 8000 - port on which the server will run

## Hope you have no trouble using my react application. Happy hacking!
